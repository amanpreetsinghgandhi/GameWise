# 🎮 GameWise  
**Level up your mind, one quest at a time.**

GameWise is your dopamine-fueled, brain-hugging bestie disguised as a mental wellness app. Built for Gen Z (aka the burnout generation), it turns self-care into a game — because let’s be honest, we’ll do anything for XP and cute avatars.

## 🧠 What It Does

GameWise helps users build healthy habits and boost mental wellness through:
- 🎯 **Daily Quests** like:
  - "Hydrate or die-drake 💧"
  - "Touch some grass, bro 🌿"
  - "Breathe, bro. Breathe. 🧘"
- 🏆 Streaks, XP, badges, and rewards to keep you motivated
- 💖 A tone that’s fun, friendly, and Gen Z–approved
